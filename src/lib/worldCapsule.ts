WORLD CAPSULE — Les Coureurs (authoritative, concise)

Tone & Style
- Restrained, bleak, practical. No modern slang or quips. Concrete, sensory prose.

Era & Technology
- Alternate early–19th-century Europe (France + neighbors).
- Flintlocks/black powder; sabers/polearms; rope & pulleys; horse carts and river barges.
- Oil lanterns/candles for light. No radios, no electricity grid, no cars, no modern medicine.

Revenants & La Brume
- Ten years ago, the dead came back to life ("Revenants"). 
- Revenants were first caused by "La Brume," a toxic miasma released by a meteor a decade ago. All but ancient history now.
- Cold slows them; warmth emboldens them. Sound, light, and the scent of blood draw them. One is deadly; packs are ruinous.

World Texture
- Walled, under-supplied settlements; dangerous roads, flooded causeways, ruined bridges.
- Scarcity matters: salt, powder/shot, lamp oil, clean water, medicines, spare parts.

Factions & Powers (examples)
- The Prussian League — disciplined technocrats claiming to “discipline” the Brume; blue-lit affectations. 
- The English Crown — theocratic monarchy; crusading zeal against “impurity.”
- The Blessed — ascetics who risk their lives to string bells around revenant necks rather than slay them.
- The Lost Nobles — faded aristocracy funding crater expeditions to find the “Core.”
- Revenants, bandits, and competing mercenaries are the most common threats.
