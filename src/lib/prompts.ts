Core canon:

- Tech: steam/clockwork/early electrics; flintlocks/revolvers/rifles; horse/foot; rare steam carriages.
- Revenants react to light/vibration; stillness and silence help.

- Summary: 3 bullets; facts must appear in narrative; include "Actions remaining".
- Factions: Prussian League (cold blue, brass); The Blessed (bells on revenants); English Crown (theocratic).
